                Xavier De Ronsay and Gaspard Augé had a few mutual friends, who
                happened to run a record label, seeking tracks for a compilation.
                With an immediate connection, the pair decided to try their hand at
                making a song. That’s when they created their breakout single, We Are
                Your Friends – a feel-good, funk-filled, instant anthem that lost the
                remix contest, but won the attention of Pedro Winter, director of the
                newly founded Ed Banger Records, who boasted Daft Punk as former
                clients. One week later, they were in his office, signing a record
